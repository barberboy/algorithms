## Notes

### Big O Notation

Growth is with respect to the input
Constants are usually dropped
Worst case is usually what we measure

O(1) - Constant Time
O(logn) - Half it every time.
O(n) - Oh of N - Linear - Do one for every input
O(nlogn) - Oh of nlogn - Do once, then half
O(n^2) - Ohof N squared
O(2^n) -
O(n!) - Oh of n factorial
